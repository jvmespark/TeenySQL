g++ server.cpp -o server
./server 8080

in another terminal:
g++ client.cpp -o client
./client 127.0.0.1 8080


idea:
- create several clustered test nodes
- each node should have its own port and ip address
- in every sql query, also call the server at end to just send a data dump of entire b-tree to every other node
- ^ this can likely be optimized to not send everything but for a working model it should suffice
- a vm and paging system should be made so it persists, or else data would just be deleted after every usage
