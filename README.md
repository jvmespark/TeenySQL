features: simple sql compiler, btree, and supports 'insert'.  
building this in c++
resources: c_stack, learnDB, sqlLite  
purpose: to learn the following concepts deeply: hardware persistance, data engineering, high performance c++, compiler technologies

ideas:
build a simple compiler first
then build the btree
implement simple store and retrieves
would be cool to also build a networking server to send data to a web app via api
the web app would be a cool visualizer tool for the database
